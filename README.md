# UnityPlugin
Modo 10's Unity editor plugin (for loading of PBR materials / textures)


#Installation
Inside your Unity project's Assets directory, create a folder called "Editor".

Put the [**MODOMaterialImporter.cs**](https://github.com/TheFoundry-Modo/UnityPlugin/blob/master/MODOMaterialImporter.cs) file from this repo inside there ([your project should now look like this](https://github.com/TheFoundry-Modo/UnityPlugin/blob/master/scriptPlacement.png)).

You're good to go!
